Imagine you’ve discovered an old box of cassette tapes in an attic. These aren't just music tapes; they contain programs and games for a computer from 1982 called the **ZX Spectrum**. This workshop is about how we rescue that "digital history" before the tapes rot away forever.

## 1. Digital Archaeology: Saving the "Pulse"
Old cassette tapes are fragile. They are made of plastic coated in rust (iron oxide) that can flake off or stick together.

* **The Challenge:** The computer doesn't "hear" music; it listens for timed pulses of sound. A "short" beep is a **0** and a "long" beep is a **1**.
* **The Rescue:** Just like a doctor uses a stethoscope, students use special software to look at the sound waves. They "clean" the audio—straightening out the signals and fixing the volume—so the digital "0s and 1s" can be read clearly again.

## 2. Real Hardware vs. Modern Shortcuts
Once we’ve saved the data, how should we play it? There is a big debate here:

* **The Modern Way:** We can put the games on an SD card (like the one in your phone) and plug it into the old computer. It’s fast and reliable.
* **The "Authentic" Way:** Is it still the same history if you don't feel the "dead flesh" rubber keys of the original keyboard? Is the 5-minute wait for a game to load part of the "experience"? The workshop teaches that **how** we used technology is just as important as the technology itself.

## 3. Dealing with "Orphaned" Files
Imagine finding a photo with no date, no name, and no location. In the digital world, we call this an **Orphaned Object**.

* Students learn how to label these rescued files so that a historian 100 years from now knows exactly what they are looking at.
* They create an "ID card" (**Metadata**) for every file, noting which specific computer it needs and even what brand of tape it originally lived on.

## 4. The "Doctor’s Checkup" (Grading the Tape)
Before you even put a tape into a player, you have to make sure it won't explode or ruin the machine. Students use a "report card" to grade the tapes:

* **Grade A:** Looks new. Ready to go!
* **Grade C:** The tape is sticky or folded. It might need to be "baked" in a special oven to remove moisture before it can be played.
* **Grade D:** There is white mold on the tape. **Danger!** Keep it away from other tapes and call a specialist.

### The Big Picture
The goal isn't just to play old video games. It’s to treat software like a **museum artifact**. Just as we preserve ancient pottery or old books, these students are learning the technical skills to make sure the first steps of the "digital age" aren't forgotten as the hardware dies out.
